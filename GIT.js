/*
    ************************ Basic Git Commands ************************
-1. mkdir git
0. cd git
1. set up your username
    git config --global user.name "Yury Shkoda"
2. set up your email address
    git config --global user.email "shkoda.yuri@gmail.com"
3. ask Git to color its output
    git config --global color.ui true
4. create testGit folder
5. cd testGit
6. git init
7. ls -la
8. open .git
9. echo '<p>Hello, world!</p>' >> index.html
10. git status
11. git add index.html
    git add .
12. git status
    The temporary area - where changes are queued up in preparation to be executed is knowing as staging
13. git commit
    13.1 press "i" (insert)
    13.2 type "This is my initial commit"
    13.3 press "esc" to exit insert mode
    13.4 type ":wq" (write then quit) and press return
14. git status
15. change index.html to have following context '<p>Hello, world?</p>'
16. git status
17. git add .
18. change index.html to have following context '<p>Goodbye, cruel world!</p>'
19. git status
    Notice that index.html is listed under "Changes to be committed” and also under "Changes not staged for commit”. This happens because Git cares about content not about files. When you ran git add . Git immediately took a copy of index.html as it looked at that precise point in time – you could delete index.html entirely and Git could still commit the changes it has queued up with no problems.
20. git commit -am 'Change message to goodbye'
    -a option, which means "stage any changes to tracked files then commit them immediately"
    -m option, which lets you write a commit message
21. echo '<p>Some Websites</p>' >> credits.html 
22. git status
23. git branch
    * - means that's the branch you are currently working on 
24. git branch credits
    credits branch is initially identical to master
25. git branch
26. git checkout credits
    Switched to branch 'credits'
27. git branch
28. git status
29. git add .
30. git commit -m 'Added credits.html'
31. git status
32. git checkout master
    credits.html disappeared
33. git status
34. git branch credits
    credits.html reappeared
35. git checkout master
36. git merge credits
37. git checkout credits
38. edit credits.html to have this content:
    <h1>Credits</h1>
    <p>Some Websites</p>
39. git commit -am 'Adding important heading.'
40. git checkout master
41. git merge credits
    It used to be difficult and sometime even dangerous to do multiple merges from a branch before Git
42. Challenge:
    42.1 Modify credits branch so that credits.html has your name in there
    42.2 Create a new branch called "contact" based off the credits branch
    42.3 In the contact branch create new file "contact.html" that contains text "Under construction".
    42.4 Merge contact into credits.
    42.5 Merge credits into master.
    Tip: you can combine "git branch" and "git checkout" into single commande "git checkout -b somebranch".

    ********************** From "begginer" to "veteran" **********************
=========== Adding and removing files ===========
1. cd ..
2. mkdir adding
3. cd adding
4. git init
5. echo "Cheese
Eggs
Strawberries
Apples" > shopping.txt
6. git add shopping.txt
7. git commit -m "Added initial shopping list"
8. Challenge: remove Eggs from shopping list using terminal only(5 min)
9. grep "Eggs" shopping.txt
10. grep -v "Eggs" shopping.txt
11. grep -v "Eggs" shopping.txt > shopping.txt
12. cat shooping.txt
!!!! one of the few Git commands that can destroy your work !!!!
13. git reset --hard
14. grep -v "Eggs" shopping.txt | tee shopping.txt
    tee writes to disc without using redirect
15. cat shopping.txt
    Piping in this way can cause race conditions, so it’s best to insert a tiny sleep call after the pipe to ensure things run in sequence.
16. grep -v "Eggs" shopping.txt | (sleep 0.1; tee shopping.txt) 
17. git status
18. git add shopping.txt
19. git status
20. git reset shopping.txt
21. git status
22. git diff
23. git diff shopping.txt
24. git add .
25. git diff
26. git diff --staged
27. git reset
    Git works with content rather than files!
28. create new file called quotes.txt and give it this content:
In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. – Obi-Wan Kenobi
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. – Spock
Do, or do not. There is no try. – Yoda
29. git add quotes.txt
30. git commit -m 'Add quotes.txt to tracked files'
31. Edit quotes.txt to have this content:
Do what I do: hold tight and pretend it’s a plan! – The Doctor
In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. – Obi-Wan Kenobi
If we’re going to be damned, let’s be damned for what we really are. – Jean-Luc Picard
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. – Spock
I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you. – Malcom Reynolds
Do, or do not. There is no try. – Yoda
32. git diff quotes.txt
33. git add -p
    "patch add mode"
    "y” means "yes, stage this hunk”
    "n” means "no, don’t stage this hunk”
    "q” means "quit, don’t stage this hunk or any others following it”
    "a” means "stage this hunk and any others in the same file”
    "d” means "don’t stage this hunk or any others in the same file”
    "/" means "search for a hunk that matches a regex”
    "s” means "split up this hunk”
    "e” means "edit this hunk”
    "?” means "print help”
34. press "s"
35. press "y"
36. press "n"
37. press "d"
38. press "a"
39. git status
    we only staged part of quotes.txt
40. git diff
41. git diff --staged
42. git commit -m 'Add one new quote and remove Eggs from shopping'
43. git rm quotes.txt
44. git rm -f quotes.txt
45. git status
46. git reset --hard
47. git rm --cached quotes.txt
48. git status
    "git rm -f" deletes a file from disk and from the repository, whereas "git rm --cached" removes a file from the repository but keeps it on disk
49. git status -s
    M(odified)
    A(dded)
    D(eleted)
    R(enamed)
    C(opied)
    U(pdated but unmerged)
    ? to mean untracked

=========== Commiting Changes ===========
50. Example of good commit message:
    "Update shopping.txt to remove Eggs (up to 50 char)

    Management came back with a request to remove Eggs from the shopping.txt file because it was causing problems for vegan users."
51. cd ..
52. mkdir commiting
53. cd commiting
54. git init
55. echo "Hello world" >> file.txt
56. git add .
57. git commit - 'Added shopping.txt'
58. git commit --amend -m 'Added file.txt'
    If you want to add or change files, you can do that too – just stage them first.
59. echo "Do or do not, there is no try - Yoda" >> quotes.txt
60. git add quotes.txt
61. git commit --amend -m 'Add file.txt and quotes.txt'

=========== Working with the commit log ===========
0. cd ..
2. git clone https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js
3. cd brain.js
4. git log
5. git log -5
6. git log --oneline
7. git log --stat
8. git log README.md
9. git log --since=2.month
10. git log --grep="Fix"
11. git shortlog -10
12. git shortlog -sn

=========== Branching and merging ===========
!!! What follows is a destructive command that will cause you to lose work. !!!
You can use "git checkout yourfilename" to revert change back to the latest commit.
1. cd ..
2. mkdir branching
3. cd branching
4. git init
5. echo "Testing 123" > test.txt
6. git add .
7. git commit -m 'Initial commit'
8. git checkout -b testing
9. echo "Blablabla" > test.txt
10. git commit -am 'Changed test.txt'
11. git checkout master
12. git branch -d testing
    If you have merged the branch elsewhere this command will execute immediately and the branch will be gone, but if you have unmerged changes Git will refuse to comply because you’ll lose data.
13. git branch -v
14. git checkout testing
14. git branch -m doomed_branch
15. git checkout master
16. git branch -D doomed_branch
17. git checkout -b testing
18. echo "Bla" > test.txt
19. git commit -am 'Changed test.txt'
20. git checkout master
21. git merge testing
22. git checkout -b risky
23. echo "Fizz" > fizzbuzz.txt
24. git add .
25. git commit -m "Changed to Fizz"
26. git checkout master
27. echo "Buzz" > fizzbuzz.txt
28. git add .
29. git commit -m "Changed to Buzz"
30. git merge risky
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
    Git doesn’t know which version is correct: Fizz or Buzz.
31. cat fizzbuzz.txt
    <<<<<< HEAD
    Buzz
    =======
    Fizz
    >>>>>>> risky
31. open fizzbuzz.txt
32. leave "Fizz" only
33. git add fizzbuzz.txt
34. git commit -m "Fixed fizzbuzz.txt"
35. git status
36. git branch --merged
37. git branch --no-nerged

=========== Remotes ===========
1. create new repository "testing" at GitHub
2. cd ..
3. mkdir remoteGit
4. cd remoteGit
5. echo "# testing" >> README.md
6. git init 
7. git add README.md
8. git commit -m "first commit"
9. git remote add origin https://github.com/YuryShkoda/testing.git
10. git push -u origin master
11. git remote -v
12. !!! git remote remove origin - to remove origin
13. use "git pull" to download changes from remote repository
14. echo "Fizz" > fizzbuzz.txt
15. git add .
16. git commit -m "Added fizzbuz.txt"
17. git push
18. git branch -r
19. git checkout -b newfeature
20. echo "Testing" > test.txt
21. git add .
22. git commit -m "Writing to new feature branch."
23. git push -u origin newfeature
    we use "git push origin newfeature" because we want to push the “newfeature” branch to the server, but also used "-u", which tells Git we want to set up tracking information at the same time. This means in the future we can just write “git push” or “git pull” from this branch and Git will know what to do.
24. cd ~/Desktop
25. mkdir testcopy
26. cd testcopy
27. git clone https://github.com/YuryShkoda/testing.git
28. cd testing
29. git branch
30. git branch -a
31. git checkout newfeature
32. git branch -avv
33. git push origin --delete newfeature
    will delete remote branch "newfeature"
34. git branch -avv

    ************************ Tips and Techniques ************************
    Any file in your working directory will get noticed by Git, which means they’ll be staged when you run the git add . command. The problem is, some files really ought not to be tracked: log files that are constantly changing will clutter your commits, cache files that can be recreated will take up space, and you might have private files such as user credentials that you don’t want pushed externally.
1. touch .gitignore
2. open .gitignore
3. edit content of .gitignore to be:
server.log
*.log
!critical.log
caches/
# this is a comment
4. The "git clean" command will look through your entire working directory for files that are not tracked, then delete them all. Because it’s destructive, git clean requires you to call it with "-f" for "force" mode, but as soon as that command is issued it will delete any and all untracked files it finds.
